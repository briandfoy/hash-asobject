=head1 NAME

Hash::AsObject - treat hashes as objects, with arbitrary accessors/mutators

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $h = Hash::AsObject->new;
    $h->foo(123);
    print $h->foo;       # prints 123
    print $h->{'foo'};   # prints 123
    $h->{'bar'}{'baz'} = 456;
    print $h->bar->baz;  # prints 456

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Hash::AsObject is a blessed hash that provides read-write
access to its elements using accessors.  (Actually, they're both accessors
and mutators.)

It's designed to act as much like a plain hash as possible; this means, for
example, that you can use methods like C<DESTROY> to get or set hash elements
with that name.  See below for more information.

=head1 METHODS

The whole point of this module is to provide arbitrary methods.  For the most
part, these are defined at runtime by a specially written C<AUTOLOAD> function.

In order to behave properly in all cases, however, a number of special methods
and functions must be supported.  Some of these are defined while others are
simply emulated in AUTOLOAD.

=over 4

=item B<new>

    $h = Hash::AsObject->new;
    $h = Hash::AsObject->new(\%some_hash);
    $h = Hash::AsObject->new(%some_other_hash);

Create a new L<Hash::AsObject|Hash::AsObject>.

If called as an instance method, this accesses a hash element 'new':

    $h->{'new'} = 123;
    $h->new;       # 123
    $h->new(456);  # 456

=item B<isa>

This method cannot be used to access a hash element 'isa', because
Hash::AsObject doesn't attempt to handle it specially.

=item B<can>

Similarly, this can't be used to access a hash element 'can'.

=item B<AUTOLOAD>

    $h->{'AUTOLOAD'} = 'abc';
    $h->AUTOLOAD;       # 'abc'
    $h->AUTOLOAD('xyz') # 'xyz'

Hash::AsObject::AUTOLOAD recognizes when AUTOLOAD is begin called as an
instance method, and treats this as an attempt to get or set the 'AUTOLOAD'
hash element.

=item B<DESTROY>

    $h->{'DESTROY'} = [];
    $h->DESTROY;    # []
    $h->DESTROY({}) # {}

C<DESTROY> is called automatically by the Perl runtime when an object goes out
of scope.  A Hash::AsObject can't distinguish this from a call to access the
element $h->{'DESTROY'}, and so it blithely gets (or sets) the hash's 'DESTROY'
element; this isn't a problem, since the Perl interpreter discards any value
that DESTROY returns when called automatically.

=item B<VERSION>

When called as a class method, this returns C<$Hash::AsObject::VERSION>; when
called as an instance method, it gets or sets the hash element 'VERSION';

=item B<import>

Since L<Hash::AsObject|Hash::AsObject> doesn't export any symbols, this method
has no special significance and you can safely call it as a method to get or
set an 'import' element.

When called as a class method, nothing happens.

=back

The methods C<can()> and C<isa()> are special, because they're defined in the
C<UNIVERSAL> class that all packages automatically inherit from.  Unfortunately,
this means that you can't use L<Hash::AsObject|Hash::AsObject> to access elements
'can' and 'isa'.

=head1 CAVEATS

No distinction is made between non-existent elements and those that are
present but undefined.  Furthermore, there's no way to delete an
element without resorting to C<< delete $h->{'foo'} >>.

Storing a hash directly into an element of a Hash::AsObject
instance has the effect of blessing that hash into
Hash::AsObject.

For example, the following code:

    my $h = Hash::AsObject->new;
    my $foo = { 'bar' => 1, 'baz' => 2 };
    print ref($foo), "\n";
    $h->foo($foo);
    print ref($foo), "\n";

Produces the following output:

    HASH
    Hash::AsObject

I could fix this, but then code like the following would throw an exception,
because C<< $h->foo($foo) >> will return a plain hash reference, not
an object:

    $h->foo($foo)->bar;

Well, I can make C<< $h->foo($foo)->bar >> work, but then code like
this won't have the desired effect:

    my $foo = { 'bar' => 123 };
    $h->foo($foo);
    $h->foo->bar(456);
    print $foo->{'bar'};  # prints 123
    print $h->foo->bar;   # prints 456

I suppose I could fix I<that>, but that's an awful lot of work for little
apparent benefit.

Let me know if you have any thoughts on this.

=head1 BUGS

Autovivification is probably not emulated correctly.

The blessing of hashes stored in a Hash::AsObject might be
considered a bug.  Or a feature; it depends on your point of view.

=head1 TO DO

=over 4

=item *

Add the capability to delete elements, perhaps like this:

    use Hash::AsObject 'deleter' => 'kill';
    $h = Hash::AsObject->new({'one' => 1, 'two' => 2});
    kill $h, 'one';

That might seem to violate the prohibition against exporting functions
from object-oriented packages, but then technically it wouldn't be
exporting it B<from> anywhere since the function would be constructed
by hand.  Alternatively, it could work like this:

    use Hash::AsObject 'deleter' => 'kill';
    $h = Hash::AsObject->new({'one' => 1, 'two' => 2});
    $h->kill('one');

But, again, what if the hash contained an element named 'kill'?

=item *

Define multiple classes in C<Hash/AsObject.pm>?  For example, there
could be one package for read-only access to a hash, one for hashes
that throw exceptions when accessors for non-existent keys are called,
etc.  But this is hard to do fully without (a) altering the underlying
hash, or (b) defining methods besides AUTOLOAD. Hmmm...
