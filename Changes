changes:
  - >
    To speed things up, AUTOLOAD() now defines accessor methods,
    which means it's only called once for each key.
  - >
    Revised tests to catch a silly coding mistake (blessing
    things into main).
  - >
    Added test for $foo->bar($myhash)->baz
  - >
    Documented the fact that hashes stored into a Hash::ObjectLike
    are always blessed as a result.
